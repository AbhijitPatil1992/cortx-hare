# Hare - Halon replacement

The scripts in this repository form a middleware layer between [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) and [Mero](http://gitlab.mero.colo.seagate.com/mero/mero) services.  Their responsibilities:

- provide initial configuration for a Mero cluster;
- mediate communications between Mero services and Consul agents.

## Roadmap

0. Write the fortnight (2-weeks) prototype.  See [plan.org](./plan.org) for details.

1. EES release (due at the end of 2019) — Halon is replaced in Mero software stack with Consul & ‘hare’ scripts.  Failover is performed by [Pacemaker](https://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/).

2. EOS release — Consul takes over Pacemaker's responsibilities.
