# Recovery Coordinator (RC) prototype.
#
# Implemented as a Consul watcher handler over the Events Queue (EQ)
# in the persistent KV store.
#
# Takes JSON array of events from stdin and processes them one after another.
# Each event is deleted from the queue after processing.
#
# NOTE: depends on jq >= 1.6 - https://stedolan.github.io/jq
#
# Run it like this:
#
#   $ consul watch -type=keyprefix -prefix eq/ proto-rc
#
