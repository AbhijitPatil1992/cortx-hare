# HaRe RFC

We collect specifications for APIs, file formats, wire protocols, and processes.

* A specification is created and modified by pull requests.
* Each specification has an editor who publishes the RFC to http://gitlab.mero.colo.seagate.com as needed.
* Specification lifecycle SHOULD follow the lifecycle defined in [COSS](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS).
* Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on Raw and Draft specifications.
